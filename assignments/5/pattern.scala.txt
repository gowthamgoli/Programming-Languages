//This code illustrates the use of "case classes" in Scala,
//used much like datatypes and pattern matching in ML.

//A case class is much like an ordinary class, but can be used
//in a "match" clause for pattern matching.  Also, an object
//of a case class can be created without the use of the "new"
//keyword.

  //case classes that derive from the abstract class Tree
